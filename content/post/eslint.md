**Job Location:** Remote

**Level:** Senior

ESLint is like spell check for code. Developers download ESLint more than 100M times each month to help find and fix problems in JavaScript and TypeScript code. Linters like ESLint give developers rapid feedback by pointing out problems interactively while editing code and automatically before changes are merged into projects. ESLint is used on more than 9M projects ranging from students learning to code to solo side projects to massive codebases at companies like Microsoft, Airbnb, Netflix, and Meta.

We recently launched the new eslint.org website. It is the result of several months of collaboration with a designer, a developer, an artist, and an animator.

Now that we have a nice place to host our documentation, we are turning our attention to the actual content. Customizability is one of ESLint’s core design principles, and that inherently requires more documentation. We’ve been adding onto the docs with each new feature since ESLint’s first release in 2013, and we don’t feel the current structure and content are suitable for the current state of the project.

## The docs have three primary audiences:

- Users visit the configuration docs to learn how to set up and run ESLint for their project or make improvements to an existing project’s configuration.
- Developers reference the API docs to build plugins, custom rules, parsers, shared configurations, and more that extend ESLint with new functionality.
- Contributors reference the developer docs for insights into how the project is organized, how to submit pull requests, and to learn how to work within the ESLint codebase.
You Will

Understand what developers are seeking from ESLint’s documentation.
Learn what existing documentation is available and how it’s organized.
Develop a plan for reorganizing and rewriting the documentation to better meet audience needs.
Progressively reorganize, update, and improve the documentation based on the plan.
Throughout the project, iterate based on feedback from developers and maintainers.
About You

You have experience writing technical and API documentation for developers.
While not a requirement, it’s certainly a bonus if you are familiar with JavaScript and ESLint.
ESLint’s documentation is in English, but developers are all around the world. You have professional technical fluency in English and care about writing that is accessible to those less familiar with English.
You are comfortable writing in Markdown for formatting.
You are comfortable with or willing to learn Git and GitHub workflows for collaborative source control and code review.
The Role

This is a project-based contract.
While you will certainly be welcome to continue contributing after the contract is complete (and some of the folks who helped on the website redesign have), that is not an expectation.
You will have a primary contact on the core maintainer team.
